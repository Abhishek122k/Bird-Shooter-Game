    <div class="info"> I'm Abhishek Naik, from Squad 50. I'm passionate about creating an exciting bird shooting game
        using
        Canvas. This concept draws inspiration from the engaging Live Books Assignment - Zombie Shooter. Our goal is to
        craft a visually captivating and challenging gaming experience that involves aiming and shooting at a variety of
        avian targets. By harnessing the power of HTML5 Canvas, we aim to deliver a seamless and immersive gameplay
        environment for players.

        In this game, players will test their marksmanship skills, reflexes, and strategic thinking as they take on a
        flock of animated birds. With stunning graphics, intuitive controls, and diverse challenges, this bird shooting
        game promises to be an addictive and entertaining pastime for both casual and avid gamers. Stay tuned as we
        embark on this exciting game development journey, combining creativity and technology to bring you a memorable
        and enjoyable gaming experience.
