        1. Single-player shooter game with 5 lives.
        <br>
        <br>
        2. Shoot down passing objects to increase your score by 1; missing decreases your lives by 1.
        <br>
        <br>
        3. Score checkpoints: Every 15 points earn you 1 life, capped at 5 lives.
        <br>
        <br>
        4. Every 25 points, a 10-second powerup grants immunity from losing lives.
        <br>
        <br>
        5. Objective: Achieve the highest score by shooting objects and strategically using powerups.
